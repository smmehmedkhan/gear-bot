"Hello World!"

GearBot is a CRUD operational product manager application.
It is built on MERN technology. 
The main application split into two sub applications.

One named gearbot-api, it's a back-end api for handling backend operations.
The API is built on node.js and express framework. For storing information in database, I used mongodb database.

Another is front-end application. Which is our main app for handling user interactions.
It's built on react.js Javascripts library.
